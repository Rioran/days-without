# days-without
A simple HTML+JS page to show the amount of days without... what?

As of 2022-11-16 the project is deployed on https://rioran.github.io/days-without/main

Checks for updates every 10 minutes.

Wanna your custom days count? Add a URL parameter "start" as a text date in ISO format and a parameter "text" with whatever message you want. Could look like this:
